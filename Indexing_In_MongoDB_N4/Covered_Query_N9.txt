# Covered Query:
=================
A covered query is a query which satisfies 2 conditions:
1. All the fields in the query are part of index.
2. All the fields returned in the query are in the same index.

In case of covered queries, MongoDBdon't even look in the actual collection. It will look
in the index and return the result. So, covered queries  very very fast.

Example:
db.student.createIndex({"age": 1, "name": 1});

-------------------------------------------------------------
db.student.find({"age": {$gte: 21}, "name": "Aman Sharma"}, 
{"_id": 0, "age": 1, "name": 1}).explain("executionStats");
-------------------------------------------------------------
PROJECTION_COVERED
IXSCAN
nReturned: 1
totalKeysExamined: 5
totalDocsExamined: 0

PROJECTION_COVERED: This means index is scanned and the result is returned. Since, the 
data to be returned is already present in the index so, there is no need to fetch 
documents from actual collection.

FETCH: This means index is scanned and the result is fetch from the actual collection.
So, it is slightly slower than PROJECTION_COVERED stage.

# Winning Plan vs Rejected Plan :
----------------------------------
If we have two indexes age_1 and age_1_name_1, then if we execute a query say:
db.student.find({"age": {$gt: 21}});
Now, which index will be used ????

If there are multiple indexes for a collection, then MongoDB extracts sample data from
the collection and tries particular query with all available indexes one by one.
MongoDB will compare their explain plan. Whichever index will provide better result on
sample data that index will win. And then MongoDB stores the winning-plan in cache so
that when next time a similar query is being executed, mongoDB knows which index to be
used.

So, if there are multiple indexes, first time the quey will take time because of the above
process but from next time the time taken will be very less as the winning-plan is already
cached.

The explain-plans which are rejected are called Rejected-plan.

The cache containing winning-plan is reset:
1. After 1000 writes
2. If index itself is reset
3. Mongo server is restarted
4. Other indexes are manipulated.


# explain() or explain("queryPlanner")
------------------------------------------


# explain("executionStats")
----------------------------
It returns info on the execution of the query or aggregation such as total no. of 
documents scanned, total no. of key examined, the time in milliseconds, etc


# explain("allPlansExecution")
-------------------------------
Provides a list of query plans that the MongoDB query optimizer considered along with 
the execution statics for each plan. This can be useful for understanding why a particular
query plan was chosen and why others are rejected . This also helps in identifying
petential performance improvements.
