=> Find productwise sale for each Seller. And also show all the sellers.
Avoid duplicates in the array.
db.sales.aggregate([
	{
		$unwind: "$varietyOfProducts"
	},
	{
		$group: {
			"_id": {"productCategory": "$productCategory"},
			"totalSale": {$sum: {$multiply: ["$quantity", "$price"]}},
			"seller": {$addToSet: "$seller"},
			"shopRating": {$addToSet: "$shopRating"},
			"varietyOfProducts": {$addToSet: "$varietyOfProducts"} // Array of arrays will be created
		}
	}
]);


$addToSet is similar to $push. The only difference is $addToSet makes an 
array which has unique elements.
